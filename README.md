# Showdown Extensions shots

I'm just having fun with Showdown extensions, exploring how I could interfere with Showdown's work to beautify Markdown while it is being parsed.

Here are some ideas I plan to explore:

- Replace `<space>?` with `<nbsp;>?` (in French, a question mark is preceeded with a space, but you don't want the line to break).
- Add thousand separators in numbers.

Of course we want to do that only in _text_. We don't want to alter citations or hyperlinks.
